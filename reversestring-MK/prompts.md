Persona: Take on the role of a Senior Frontend Developer.
Context: I am building a simple web utility that reverses a string. I have two files: index.html and script.js.
Desired Outcome: Provide the HTML structure for a text input and a "Reverse" button, plus the JavaScript logic to take the input value, reverse it (e.g., "AI4Devs" becomes "sveD4IA"), and display the result on the page.
Tone + Style: Use modern ES6+ JavaScript. Keep the UI clean and follow web accessibility best practices (labels for inputs, etc.). Use comments to explain the reversal logic. Add a copy button for the funtionality of making a copy of the reversed string.
# Of Options: Ensure the logic handles empty strings and multiple words correctly.
Output Style: Provide the code for index.html and script.js separately. Do not include external CSS files; use simple inline styles or a small <style> block in the HTML if needed.
